  abstract  = {Understanding the digital jump of bank customers is key to design strategies to bring on board and keep online users, as well as to explain the increasing competition from new providers of financial services (such as BigTech and FinTech). This paper employs a machine learning approach to examine the digitalization process of bank customers using a comprehensive consumer finance survey. By employing a set of algorithms (random forests, conditional inference trees and causal forests) this paper identities the features predicting bank customers’ digitalization process, illustrates the sequence of consumers’ decision-making actions and explores the existence of causal relationships in the digitalization process. Random forests are found to provide the highest performance–they accurately predict 88.41% of bank customers’ online banking adoption and usage decisions. We find that the adoption of digital banking services begins with information-based services (e.g., checking account balance), conditional on the awareness of the range of online services by customers, and then is followed by transactional services (e.g., online/mobile money transfer). The diversification of the use of online channels is explained by the consciousness about the range of services available and the safety perception. A certain degree of complementarity between bank and non-bank digital channels is also found. The treatment effect estimations of the causal forest algorithms confirm causality of the identified explanatory factors. These results suggest that banks should address the digital transformation of their customers by segmenting them according to their revealed preferences and offering them personalized digital services. Additionally, policymakers should promote financial digitalization, designing policies oriented towards making consumers aware of the range of online services available.},

  abstract = {<p>Most machine learning-based methods predict outcomes rather than understanding causality. Machine learning methods have been proved to be efficient in finding correlations in data, but unskilful to determine causation. This issue severely limits the applicability of machine learning methods to infer the causal relationships between the entities of a biological network, and more in general of any dynamical system, such as medical intervention strategies and clinical outcomes system, that is representable as a network. From the perspective of those who want to use the results of network inference not only to understand the mechanisms underlying the dynamics, but also to understand how the network reacts to external stimuli (e. g. environmental factors, therapeutic treatments), tools that can understand the causal relationships between data are highly demanded. Given the increasing popularity of machine learning techniques in computational biology and the recent literature proposing the use of machine learning techniques for the inference of biological networks, we would like to present the challenges that mathematics and computer science research faces in generalising machine learning to an approach capable of understanding causal relationships, and the prospects that achieving this will open up for the medical application domains of systems biology, the main paradigm of which is precisely network biology at any physical scale.</p>},
